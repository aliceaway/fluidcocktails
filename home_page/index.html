<h2>unpacking fluidcocktails</h2>
    <p>I mean yeah, maybe fluidcocktails seems like an obvious thing? Cocktails are liquid, so... fluid. Duh! But the fluid part of fluidcocktails means so much more to me. 
       <br> The first time I cut my hair short I started getting "excuse me sir" or "thanks son" from strangers a lot, which made me realize that I was unbothered by being misgendered. This was confusing to me, since in the queer communities I was a part of, preferred pronouns were so vital to keeping my friends feeling safe and respected. Then I saw the Ruby Rose video of Ruby changing from a typically girly outfit into a totally masculine presenting one, and I began to research more about gender fluidity. Finding out more about it opened up so many doors for me, helping me understand more of who I am, and how I want to present myself to the world. I'd never really fit into a gender binary, but there was no way I could've come up with that diagnosis in my own. Being able to express myself anywhere or nowhere along the gender spectrum was so freeing, and allowed me to explore my idendity in ways I could have never imagined.
       <br> I started bartending when I was 18, on the gayest staff I've ever worked with. It was incredible to have inspiration everywhere I turned: bartenders who knew so much about the service industry, drink mixing, beer, and wine, and who also happened to be people that took me in as a confused little queer and ensure me that there would always be a space for me somewhere. It was my first chosen family, and they taught me more than I'll ever be able to thank them for.
       <br> These two identities of mine, a genderfluid person, and a creative mixoligst, just seemed like a natural thing to put together. I'm passionate about both, but obviously cocktail making doesn't need an advocate the way gender identity does. This platform of fluidcocktails aims to teach, share, explore, and always always experiment in every aspect of life, while remaining fun and making drinks. I welcome everyone into this community in whatever capacity that may be, as long as you always keep an open mind.
       <br> -Alice
